The Synaptic Plasticity Project

The goal of this web page is to encourage people and educate them about the strength of the human mind and body on a microscopic level.


This will be a collaboration of resources that emphasize the capabilities of our ever evolving brain. 

These educational techniques will be demonstrated through podcasts, articles, books, and meditations from my personal favorite teachers/professors/doctors.
